<h3>General <a href="#general">#</a></h3>

<p>
The Onionoo service is designed as a RESTful web service.
Onionoo clients send HTTP GET requests to the Onionoo server which
responds with JSON-formatted replies.
Onionoo clients and their developers should follow a few rules:
</p>

<h4>Compression</h4>
<p>
Clients should include an <strong>"Accept-Encoding:
gzip"</strong> header in their requests and handle gzip-compressed
responses.
Only requests starting at a certain size will be compressed by the
server.
</p>

<h4>Caching</h4>
<p>Clients should make use of the <strong>"Last-Modified"</strong>
header of responses and include that timestamp in a
<strong>"If-Modified-Since"</strong> header of subsequent requests.
</p>

<h4>Response codes</h4>
<p>
Clients should handle response codes by
distinguishing between client and server errors, and if there's a problem,
informing their users about the kind of problem.
The following response codes are used:
</p>

<ul class="properties">

<li>
<b>200 OK</b>
<p>
The request was processed successfully.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<b>304 Not Modified</b>
<p>
Server data has not changed since the
<strong>"If-Modified-Since"</strong> header included in the request.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<b>400 Bad Request</b>
<p>
The request for a known resource could not be processed because of bad
syntax.
This is most likely a client problem.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<b>404 Not Available</b>
<p>
The request could not be processed because the requested resource could
not be found.
This is most likely a client problem.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<b>500 Internal Server Error</b>
<p>
There is an unspecific problem with
the server which the service operator may not yet be aware of.
Please check if there's already a bug report for this problem, and if not,
file one.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<b>503 Service Unavailable</b>
<p>
The server is temporarily down for
maintenance, or there is a temporary problem with the server that the
service operator is already aware of.
Only file a bug report if this problem persists.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<b>504 Gateway Timeout</b>
<p>
The server received an outdated response from an auxiliary provider.
Specifically, the hourly updater is out of operation, and so the data
provided by the accompanying response is stale. In this situation,
clients are recommended to use the <b>relays_published</b> and
<b>bridges_published</b> fields to determine how they prefer to proceed.

Please check if there's already a bug report for this problem, and if
not, file one.
</p>
</li>

</ul>

<h4>Protocol versions</h4>
<p>
There are plenty of reasons why we may have
to change the protocol described here.
Clients should be able to handle all valid JSON responses, ignoring
unknown fields and not breaking horribly in case of missing fields.
Protocol changes will be announced here by writing deprecated API parts in
<strong><font color="red">red</font></strong> and new parts in
<strong><font color="blue">blue</font></strong>.
Deprecated parts will be removed one month after their announcement.
If you want to be informed of upcoming protocol changes, subscribe to the
<a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/onionoo-announce">onionoo-announce</a>
mailing list.
</p>

<p>All responses contain a <strong>"version"</strong> string that
indicates whether clients can parse the document or not.
Version strings consist of a major and a minor version number.
The major version number is raised when previously required fields are
dropped or turned into optional fields, when request parameters or
response documents are removed, or when there are structural changes.
The minor version number is raised when new fields, request parameters, or
response documents are added or optional fields are dropped.
If clients support the same major version given in a response but only a
lower minor version, they should be able to parse the document but may not
understand all fields.
If clients support a lower major version, they should not attempt to parse
a document, because there may be backward-incompatible changes.</p>

<p>Responses may also contain the optional
<strong>"next_major_version_scheduled"</strong> field that announces when
the next major version is scheduled to be deployed.
Clients should inform their users that they should upgrade to the next
major protocol version before the provided date.</p>

<p>The following versions have been used in the past six months or are
scheduled to be deployed in the next months:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>1.0</strong>: First assigned version number on August 31,
2014.</li>
<li><strong>1.1</strong>: Added optional "next_major_version_scheduled"
field on September 16, 2014.</li>
<li><strong>1.2</strong>: Added qualified search terms to "search"
parameter on October 17, 2014.</li>
<li><strong>2.0</strong>: Extended search parameter to base64-encoded
fingerprints on November 15, 2014.</li>
<li><strong>2.1</strong>: Removed optional "advertised_bandwidth_fraction"
field from details documents and optional "advertised_bandwidth" and
"advertised_bandwidth_fraction" fields from weights documents on November
16, 2014.</li>
<li><strong>2.2</strong>: Removed optional "pool_assignment" field and
added "transports" field to bridge details documents on December 8,
2014.</li>
<li><strong>2.3</strong>: Added optional "flags" field to uptime
documents on March 22, 2015.</li>
<li><strong>2.4</strong>: Added optional "effective_family" field to
details documents on July 3, 2015.</li>
<li><strong>2.5</strong>: Added optional "measured" field to details
documents on August 13, 2015.</li>
<li><strong>2.6</strong>: Added optional "alleged_family" and
"indirect_family" fields and deprecated optional "family" field in details
documents on August 25, 2015.</li>
<li><strong>3.0</strong>: Extended search parameter to match any 4 hex
characters of a space-separated fingerprint on November 15, 2015.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h4>Parameters</h4>
<p>
Each of the methods can be parameterized to select only a subset of relay
and/or bridge documents that are currently running or that have been
running in the past week.
(The <strong>fingerprint</strong> parameter is special here, because it
allows selecting a specific relay or bridge, regardless of whether it has
been running in the past week.)
If multiple parameters are specified, they are combined using a logical
AND operation, meaning that only the intersection of relays and bridges
matching all parameters is returned.
If the same parameter is specified more than once, only the first
parameter value is considered.
</p>

<ul class="properties">

<li>
<b>type</b>
<p>
Return only relay (parameter value
<strong>relay</strong>) or only bridge documents (parameter value
<strong>bridge</strong>).
Parameter values are case-insensitive.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<b>running</b>
<p>
Return only running (parameter value
<strong>true</strong>) or only non-running relays and/or bridges
(paramter value
<strong>false</strong>).
Parameter values are case-insensitive.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<b>search</b>
<p>
Return only (1) relays with the parameter value matching (part of a)
nickname, (possibly $-prefixed) beginning of a hex-encoded fingerprint,
any 4 hex characters of a space-separated fingerprint, beginning of a
base64-encoded fingerprint without trailing equal signs, or beginning of
an IP address, (2) bridges with (part of a) nickname or (possibly
$-prefixed) beginning of a hashed hex-encoded fingerprint, and (3) relays
and/or bridges matching a given qualified search term.
Searches by relay IP address include all known addresses used for onion
routing and for exiting to the Internet.
Searches for beginnings of IP addresses are performed on textual
representations of canonical IP address forms, so that searches using CIDR
notation or non-canonical forms will return empty results.
Searches are case-insensitive, except for base64-encoded fingerprints.
If multiple search terms are given, separated by spaces, the intersection
of all relays and bridges matching all search terms will be returned.
Complete hex-encoded fingerprints should always be hashed using SHA-1,
regardless of searching for a relay or a bridge, in order to not
accidentally leak non-hashed bridge fingerprints in the URL.
Qualified search terms have the form "key:value" (without double quotes)
with "key" being one of the parameters listed here except for "search",
"fingerprint", "order", "limit", "offset", and "fields", and "value" being
the string that will internally be passed to that parameter.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<b>lookup</b>
<p>
Return only the relay with the parameter
value matching the fingerprint or the bridge with the parameter value
matching the hashed fingerprint.
Fingerprints should always be hashed using SHA-1, regardless of looking up
a relay or a bridge, in order to not accidentally leak non-hashed bridge
fingerprints in the URL.
Lookups only work for full fingerprints or hashed fingerprints consisting
of 40 hex characters.
Lookups are case-insensitive.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<b>fingerprint</b>
<p>
Return only the relay with the parameter value matching the fingerprint
or the bridge with the parameter value matching the hashed fingerprint.
Fingerprints must consist of 40 hex characters, case does not matter.
This parameter is quite similar to the <strong>lookup</strong> parameter
with two exceptions:
(1) the provided relay fingerprint or hashed bridge fingerprint <i>must
not</i> be hashed (again) using SHA-1;
(2) the response will contain any matching relay or bridge regardless of
whether they have been running in the past week.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<b>country</b>
<p>
Return only relays which are located in the
given country as identified by a two-letter country code.
Filtering by country code is case-insensitive.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<b>as</b>
<p>
Return only relays which are located in the
given autonomous system (AS) as identified by the AS number (with or
without preceding "AS" part).
Filtering by AS number is case-insensitive.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<b>flag</b>
<p>
Return only relays which have the
given relay flag assigned by the directory authorities.
Note that if the flag parameter is specified more than once, only the
first parameter value will be considered.
Filtering by flag is case-insensitive.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<b>first_seen_days</b>
<p>
Return only relays or bridges which
have first been seen during the given range of days ago.
A parameter value "x-y" with x &lt;= y returns relays or bridges that have
first been seen at least x and at most y days ago.
Accepted short forms are "x", "x-", and "-y" which are interpreted as
"x-x", "x-infinity", and "0-y".
</p>
</li>

<li>
<b>last_seen_days</b>
<p>
Return only relays or bridges which
have last been seen during the given range of days ago.
A parameter value "x-y" with x &lt;= y returns relays or bridges that have
last been seen at least x and at most y days ago.
Accepted short forms are "x", "x-", and "-y" which are interpreted as
"x-x", "x-infinity", and "0-y".
Note that relays and bridges that haven't been running in the past week
are not included in results, so that setting x to 8 or higher will lead to
an empty result set.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<b>contact</b>
<p>
Return only relays with the parameter value
matching (part of) the contact line.
If the parameter value contains spaces, only relays are returned which
contain all space-separated parts in their contact line.
Only printable ASCII characters are permitted in the parameter value,
some of which need to be percent-encoded (# as %23, % as %25, &#38; as
%26, + as %2B, and / as %2F).
Comparisons are case-insensitive.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<b>family</b>
<p>
Return only the relay whose fingerprint matches the parameter value and
all relays that this relay has listed in its family by fingerprint and
that in turn have listed this relay in their family by fingerprint.
If relays have listed other relays in their family by nickname, those
family relationships will not be considered, regardless of whether they
have the Named flag or not.
The provided relay fingerprint must consist of 40 hex characters where
case does not matter, and it must not be hashed using SHA-1.
Bridges are not contained in the result, regardless of whether they define
a family.
</p>
</li>

</ul>

<p>
Response documents can be reduced in size by requesting only a subset
of contained fields.
</p>

<ul class="properties">

<li>
<b>fields</b>
<p>
Comma-separated list of fields that will be
included in the result.
So far, only top-level fields in relay or bridge objects of details
documents can be specified, e.g.,
<strong>nickname,hashed_fingerprint</strong>.
If the fields parameter is provided, all other fields which are not
contained in the provided list will be removed from the result.
Field names are case-insensitive.
</p>
</li>

</ul>

<p>
Relay and/or bridge documents in the response can be ordered and
limited by providing further parameters.
If the same parameter is specified more than once, only the first
parameter value is considered.
</p>

<ul class="properties">

<li>
<b>order</b>
<p>
Re-order results by a comma-separated list
of fields in ascending or descending order.
Results are first ordered by the first list element, then by the second,
and so on.
Possible fields for ordering are: <strong>consensus_weight</strong>.
Field names are case-insensitive.
Ascending order is the default; descending order is selected by prepending
fields with a minus sign (<strong>-</strong>).
Relays or bridges which don't have any value for a field to be ordered by
are always appended to the end, regardless or sorting order.
The ordering is defined independent of the requested document type and
does not require the ordering field to be contained in the document.
If no <strong>order</strong> parameter is given, ordering of results is
undefined.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<b>offset</b>
<p>
Skip the given number of relays and/or
bridges.
Relays are skipped first, then bridges.
Non-positive <strong>offset</strong> values are treated as zero and don't
change the
result.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<b>limit</b>
<p>
Limit result to the given number of
relays and/or bridges.
Relays are kept first, then bridges.
Non-positive <strong>limit</strong> values are treated as zero and lead
to an empty
result.
When used together with <strong>offset</strong>, the offsetting step
precedes the
limiting step.

<h4>Relay uptime objects</h4>

<p>
Relay uptime objects contain the following key-value pairs:
</p>

<ul class="properties">

<li>
<b>fingerprint</b>
<code class="typeof">string</code>
<span class="required-true">required</span>
<p>

<li>
<b>uptime</b>
<code class="typeof">object</code>
<span class="required-false">optional</span>
<p>
Object containing graph history objects with the fractional uptime of this
relay.
Keys are string representation of the time period covered by the graph
history object.
Keys are fixed strings <strong>"1_week"</strong>,
<strong>"1_month"</strong>, <strong>"3_months"</strong>,
<strong>"1_year"</strong>, and <strong>"5_years"</strong>.
Keys refer to the last known uptime history of a relay, not to the time
when the uptime document was published.
A graph history object is only contained if the time period it covers is
not already contained in another graph history object with shorter time
period and higher data resolution.
The unit is fractional uptime from 0 to 1.
Contained graph history objects may contain null values if less than 20%
of network statuses have been processed for a given time period.

<h3>Example usage <a href="#examples">#</a>
</h3>

<p>
The following examples illustrate how to build requests for some trivial
and some more complex use cases.
While Onionoo is designed mainly for developers and not end users, there
may be cases when it's easier to quickly write a specific query Onionoo
rather than to find an Onionoo client that provides the desired
information.
</p>

<pre>https://onionoo.torproject.org/summary?limit=4</pre>

<p>
This first query returns the first four summary documents that Onionoo can
find.
The <code>limit</code> parameter should always be used while developing
new queries to avoid downloading huge responses.
</p>

<pre>https://onionoo.torproject.org/summary?limit=4&search=moria</pre>

<p>
The second query restricts results to relays and bridges containing the
string "moria" in one of a few searched fields.
</p>

<pre>https://onionoo.torproject.org/details?limit=4&search=moria</pre>

<p>
The third query switches from the short summary documents to the longer
details documents containing, well, more details.
</p>

<pre>https://onionoo.torproject.org/details?limit=4&search=moria&fields=nickname</pre>

<p>
The fourth query adds the <code>fields</code> parameter which removes all
fields except the specified ones from the result.
This parameter is only implemented for details documents.
</p>

<pre>https://onionoo.torproject.org/details?limit=4&search=moria&fields=nickname&order=-consensus_weight</pre>

<p>
The fifth query sorts results by relay consensus weight from largest to
smallest.
</p>

<p>
Obviously, this query can be made even more complex by adding more
parameters, and in some cases this is necessary and useful.
Please refer to the protocol specification for details.
